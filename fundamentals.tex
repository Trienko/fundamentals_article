This article explains and illustrates the use of \LaTeX\ in preparing manuscripts

AJP authors.

\section{Fundamentals of Interferometry}

\subsection{Course Material}
\begin{figure}[h!]
% The bracketed code determines the figure's placement:  "h" stands for 
% "here", telling LaTeX to put the figure as close to the current location 
% as possible.  The ! overrides LaTeX's tendency to try to find a location 
% that it thinks is better.  But don't agonize over the exact figure placement 
% in your submitted manuscript.  For your initial submission, just make sure 
% each figure is reasonably close to where it's first referenced.

lectures, an ipython notebook based textbook and CASA. Each of these categories contribute an equal amount to the total body of teaching material.}

\end{figure}

The novelty of the Fundamentals of Interferometry course lies in the teaching material that is used to help the students learn. We make use of three
mediums in particular:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Conventional lectures: We use conventional lectures. xx hours of lecturing. In the lectures we focus primarily on getting the main points across. The exact details
 can be studied in the book. We also record the lectures and make them available to the students so that they can refer back to the material at any point.
 \item Ipython notebook based textbook: We use a novel text book in this course. It consists of ipython notebooks. The main drawback of a conventional 
 textbook is that complicated mathematical ideas are not supplemented with executable computer code. It is much easier to learn a mathematical construct 
 if you can also inspect a small piece of executable code that implements the idea. We address this short coming in the electronic book by providing 
 executable pieces of python code that implements some of the complicated ideas, making it easier to understand.
 \item CASA: CASA is a reduction package. In interferometry it is crucial for learners to not only understand the theoretical concepts, but to be able to apply it 
 to real data. That is why each student is required to reduce a real KAT7 dataset as part of the course. KAT7 is a proof of concept instrument whose main purpose 
 is to be used as a teaching tool. In this course students have access to real non-sensitive sceintific data which they may use to learn the basics.

\section{Uninteresting stuff}

Appendices are for material that is needed for completeness but
not sufficiently interesting to include in the main body of the paper.  Most
articles don't need any appendices, but feel free to use them when
appropriate.  This sample article needs an appendix only to illustrate how 
to create an appendix.

\bibitem{labelnames} Thinking up a good label name takes a moment, but 
it's worth the trouble; we strongly advise against using labels like 
\texttt{eq2}, which become extremely confusing after you decide to add 
another equation before Eq.~(\ref{deriv}).
